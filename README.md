![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlawton2/Design-Patterns/master/Banner3.png)

## Description
This project demonstrates two of the many design patterns in OOP. The first is the Singleton which is a creational pattern. There are many types of singletons you can create, however only 3 are demostrated. Next is a behavioral pattern called the Template. The template is the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. 

## Project Details
Created in Java, but design patterns can be used in any OOP language.
